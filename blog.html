			<h2>Self care</h2>
			<p><b>•Get regular exercise :=></b>Just 30 minutes of walking every day can boost your mood and improve your health. Small amounts of exercise add up, so don’t
                 be discouraged if you can’t do 30 minutes at one time.<br>
               <b>• Eat healthy, regular meals and stay hydrated:=></b>A balanced diet and plenty of water can improve your energy and focus throughout the day. Pay
                attention to your intake of caffeine and alcohol and how they affect your mood and well-being—for some, decreasing caffeine and alcohol consumption can be helpful.<br>
                <b>•Make sleep a priority:=></b> Stick to a schedule, and make sure you’re getting enough sleep. Blue light from devices and screens can make it harder to
                 fall asleep, so reduce blue light exposure from your phone or computer before bedtime.<br>
                <b>•Try a relaxing activity:=></b> Explore relaxation or wellness programs or apps, which may incorporate meditation, muscle relaxation, or breathing
                 exercises. Schedule regular times for these and other healthy activities you enjoy, such as listening to music, reading, spending time in nature, and 
                 engaging in low-stress hobbies.<br>
                <b>•Set goals and priorities:=></b>Decide what must get done now and what can wait. Learn to say “no” to new tasks if you start to feel like you’re taking
                 on too much. Try to appreciate what you have accomplished at the end of the day.<br>
                <b>•Practice gratitude:=></b> Remind yourself daily of things you are grateful for. Be specific. Write them down or replay them in your mind.<br>
                <b>•Focus on positivity:=></b>Identify and challenge your negative and unhelpful thoughts.<br>
                Stay connected. Reach out to friends or family members who can provide emotional support and practical help..</p>

			<h2>Coping skill</h2>
			<p>
               <b>• Exercise:=></b>
                Exercise isn’t just about building muscle or losing weight; it’s incredibly effective for mental well-being too. Physical activity releases endorphins, 
                which act as natural mood lifters. They can also help you sleep better, reduce stress, and improve self-esteem.<br>
                
                <b>•Deep Breathing:=></b>
                It might sound overly simple, but deep breathing is a powerful tool. It works by activating the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps control 
                the relaxation response in your body.<br>
                
               <b>•Mindfulness and Meditation:=></b>
                Mindfulness involves being fully present and engaged in the here and now. It’s shown to reduce symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. It can even 
                improve concentration and increase feelings of contentment<br>
            
                <b>•Positive Affirmations:=></b>
                Affirmations are positive statements that can help you challenge and control self-sabotaging thoughts. Repeating these affirmations can improve your
                 outlook and imbue your approach to challenges with positivity.<br>
                
                <b>•Drawing and Painting:=></b>
                 Artistic expression through drawing and painting can be incredibly therapeutic. Even if you’re not a trained artist, the act of creating something can 
                 instill a sense of accomplishment and peace. It offers a tactile, engaging way to disconnect from digital distractions and tune into your feelings.<br>
                
                 <b>•Writing:=></b>
                 Writing provides a structured way to explore your thoughts and feelings. Whether it’s journaling, poetry, or even writing a short story, this form of
                  self-expression can bring clarity to chaotic emotions.<br>
                
                  <b>•Music:=></b>
                  Whether you’re listening to it, playing an instrument, or even composing, music can be profoundly healing. It offers a wide range of emotional 
                  experiences and can serve as a form of emotional release.<br></p>

                <p>  <b>•Prioritize sleep:=></b> Practice good sleep hygiene and aim for seven to nine hours of sleep per night. getting enought sleep in a dark, vegetables, nuts, seeds
                and confortable environmnt can help improve is also important.<br>
            <b>•Cut back on social media:=></b> To spend less time on social media, try to:<br>
            1. keep your phone in a drawer or outside your bedroom while sleeping<br>
            2. make a list of alternate, more meaningful activities to replace your usual scrolling sessions<br>
            3. turn off notifications or delete social apps from your phone<br>
            <b>•Practice mindfulness:=></b>Mindfulness can reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and chronic pain. Building mindfulness can be as simple as repeatedly bringing 
            yourself back to the present throughout the day. You can also consider starting a formal meditation 
            practice centered on mindfulness, where you focus on bringing your attention back to your breath or another anchor.<br>
            <b>•Pray or meditat:=></b>Connecting with something bigger than yourself can help protect your mental health. You do not have to be religious to benefit from 
            the positive effects of prayer or meditation.<br>
            <b>•Connect with others:=></b> Isolation is both a cause and a symptom of mental illness. Join a club of like-minded people or try a new hobby. Engage with others
                 daily, even if you just call someone you haven't spoken to in a while.<br></p>
